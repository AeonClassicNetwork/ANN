[size=14pt]AEON started with a vision to become a lightweight and faster version of XMR that can run on any hardware. Somewhere on the way to that goal, we got a bit sidetracked. I want to make this better, and to do that, we need to start from scratch with a codebase that is actively maintained and build the right team to see it through. That's why I'm releasing Aeon Classic, a re-envisioning of the original intentions of the Aeon Project; bringing cryptocurrency mining and transactions to mobile phones across the world. Join us today.

We are posting this announcement at exactly the same time we are launching the chain. [b]There will be no premine or ICO of any kind.[/b][/size]
